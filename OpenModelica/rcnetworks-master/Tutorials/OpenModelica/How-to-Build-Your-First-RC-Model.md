# Introduction
This is a simple tutorial how to start a simple RC model based on the wall composition information you collected.

# Data Preparation
To build a RC model for the wall, you first need know the construction of the wall. Here a reference for a high thermal mass wall and a low thermal mass wall is used for the tutorial purpose.

# Open RCNetworks
For this course, we provide a base library for building RC network models, RCNetworks. 
Therefore, before we start our first RC model, we need open RCNetworks package in OpenModelica.

First, start OpenModelica environment by openning OMEdit. The sucessful start should have the following interface.

Second, load RCNetworks.
